      <h4>Grab a cup of tea and let me tell you about myself</h4>
      <p>I’m a historian turned techie. I recently graduated with a Master’s degree in History.
        For the longest time I wanted to pursue a career in Academia (Professor McGonnagal might have had something to do with that…).<br>
        <br>
        Throughout my last year at University I discovered that I was more and more drawn to alternative career paths.
        I kept reading about coding bootcamps, other people’s career transitions, listened to tech podcasts religiously.
        In December 2019 I finally made the jump.<br>
        <br>
        I enrolled in Skillcrush’s ‘Break into tech’ blueprint and discovered the world of tech. And coding. And web design.<br>
        <br>
        I slowly discovered my love for creating &mdash; mocking up ideas and designs and turning them into beautiful, functional websites.

      <p><strong>My technical skills</strong><br>
        Today I offer web design and development for busy and passionate women entrepreneurs and women-owned businesses. My current but growing skillset:<br></p>
        <ol>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>Photoshop</li>
          <li>Web Design</li>
        </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>My previous work experiences</strong><br>
        When I'm not designing and building websites I work at Frankfurt University, Germany,
        where I help students reach their university-related or professional goals and teach in-person
        workshops on time management, productivity, goal-setting and motivation.<br>
        <br>I also oversee a team of several student assistants and Peer-Coaches, manage day to day operations
        and communications, and design and develop digital instructional materials for self-study purposes.<br>
    </div>
    <div class="about-me-text-2">
      <p><strong>What I am passionate about</strong><br>I'm a strong believer in continuous learning and curiosity. I'm convinced that we can find answers to most
      questions through research and perseverance. Already throughout my studies I developed a passion for problem-solving. If you encounter an issue or a problem with your website,
      I will use all my creativity to figuring it out for you.<br>
        <br><strong>How we can work together</strong><br>
        Giving another person your hard earned cash is daunting, so much can depend on finding the exactly right person for the job.
        I know this. That’s why I think it is super important to get to know the people you might be working with and decide if it’s a good fit.<br>
